# Practice-C

This repository is a record of my practice sessions with C programming language.

Following are somethings that I will be attempting to implement

* Common header files like string.h
* Implementation of common ADT'S.
* Algorithmic problems from competitive coding platforms like SPOJ and CodeChef.
